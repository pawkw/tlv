Runs M5 and SandPiper as required based on file-type line.
The file-type line is the first line of the file and should start with:
        "\m5_TLV_version" to utilize M5 prior to SandPiper, or
        "\TLV_version" to utilize only SandPiper, or
        neither of the above for a pure SV file.

For M5 usage, note that TLV library file inclusion is permitted within/below the current
        working directory or within/below the last "." or ".." in the input file path.
Usage: /home/app/sandpiper/bin/sandpiper [--help] -i <tlv-[m5-]in-file> -o <sv-out-file> [--read-only] [--m5inc <m5-incl-path1> [--m5inc ...]] [--m5out <m5-out-file>] [--verbose] [--no-color] [--debug] [--fmtNoSource] [--pass <passing-exit-status>] [<sandpiper-args>] [<tlv-[m5-]in-file> <sv-out-file>]
        -i <tlv-[m5-]in-file>: TLV input file.
        -o <tlv-out-file>: SV output file.
        --tlv: Error if the file is not recognized as a TLV (or M5 TLV) file.
        --read-only: Generated files will be read-only.
        --m5inc <path>: Provide one include path for M5 (in addition to standard SandPiper M5 include path.
        --m5out <file>: Output file for M5 run, if M5 is run. (Alternately, use --obj)
        --m5def <name>=<value>: Defines M5 macro <name> assigned to <value> for M5 preprocessing.
        --webcache <dir>: Directory where cached URL include files are stored (can be shared across runs).
        --obj <dir>: Directory where intermediate files can be written. Directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
        --fmtNoSource: Do not generate \source tags for correlating pre- and post-M5 code.
        --pass <status>: Determines the exit status of this script from the exit status of sandpiper.
                        SandPiper status at or below this value returns a zero status, otherwise the exit status from sandpiper is returned.
        --verbose: Prints extra debug information.
        --no-color: Disables colored output.
        --debug: Creates intermediate files for M5 preprocessing.
        <sandpiper-args>: Arguments that are passed through to the raw (no-M5) SandPiper ("java -jar sandpiper.jar -h").
                --bestsv                 Optimize the readability/maintainability of the       
                                           generated SV, unconstrained by correlation w/ TLV   
                                           source.                                             
                --clkAlways              Use a clocking strategy for deasserted 'when'         
                                           conditions (vs. clkGate and clkEnable) in which all 
                                           sequential elements use an always-enabled clock     
                                           with no clock gating or clock enabling.  Thus, no   
                                           power is saved from clock distribution and avoided  
                                           logic propagation.  State signal values are held    
                                           using explicit recirculation.                       
                --clkEnable              Use a clocking strategy for deasserted 'when'         
                                           conditions (vs. clkGate and clkAlways) in which     
                                           'when' conditions are applied as clock enables to   
                                           staging flip-flops.  (The condition is not applied  
                                           to latches.)  It is generally recommended to use    
                                           this in combination with --clkStageAlways.          
                                           Explicit recirculation of state is produced only    
                                           when state is consumed in the cycle that the next   
                                           state value is produced (including --debugSigs*     
                                           modes).  This overrides --clkAlways.                
                --clkGate                Use a clocking strategy for deasserted 'when'         
                                           conditions (vs. clkEnable and clkAlways) in which   
                                           gated clock signals are provided to sequential      
                                           elements.  Power is saved in clock distribution and 
                                           by avoiding the propagation of unused values.       
                                           Explicit recirculation of state is produced only    
                                           when state is consumed in the cycle that the next   
                                           state value is produced (including --debugSigs*     
                                           modes).  This is the default and takes precedence   
                                           over the other two --clk* flags.                    
                --clkStageAlways         Modify the gating or enabling clocking strategy for   
                                           'when' conditions such that gating/enabling is      
                                           applied only to the first flip-flop after each      
                                           assignment with subsequent staging using the free-  
                                           running clock.  This strategy can reduce area for   
                                           gating/enabling while still saving dynamic power by 
                                           avoiding the propagation of unused values.  Less    
                                           power may be saved in clock distribution.           
                --compiler               The HDL compiler for which to tune generated HDL.     
                                           Legal values are: "vcs", "modelsim", and            
                                           "verilator".                                        
                --conversion             Optimize output to support manual conversion for      
                                           Verilog/SystemVerilog.  Pipesignals can be mixed    
                                           case, and (project-specific) SV signal name mapping 
                                           should be optimized to preserve pipesignal names.   
                --debugSigs              Generate HDL signals orginized for optimal debug.     
                                           These signals are copies of the "real" ones, with   
                                           one signal per pipesignal (per replicated context), 
                                           organized by hierarchy, pipeline, 'when'            
                                           conditions, and pipestage.                          
                --debugSigsGtkwave       An alternate (or addition) to --debugSigs, but        
                                           avoiding bugs with GTKWave.                         
                --debugSigsYosys         An alternate (or addition) to --debugSigs, but        
                                           avoiding bugs and appropriate for use with Yosys.   
                --fmtDeclSingleton       Each HDL signal is declared in its own declaration    
                                           statement with its own type specification.          
                --fmtDeclUnifiedHier     [Not yet supported.] Declare signals in a unified     
                                           design hierarchy in the generated file, as opposed  
                                           to inline with scope lines in the translated file.  
                                           (No impact if --fmtFlatSignals.)                    
                --fmtEscapedNames        Use escaped HDL names that resemble TLV names as      
                                           closely as possible.                                
                --fmtFlatSignals         Declare signals at the top level scope in the         
                                           generated file, and do not use hierarchical signal  
                                           references.                                         
                --fmtFullHdlHier         Provide HDL hierarchy for all scopes, including non-  
                                           replicated scopes.                                  
                --fmtInlineInjection     Provide X-injection and state recirculation for       
                                           assignments under 'when' conditions in the          
                                           assignment expressions themself where possible,     
                                           rather than in separate manufactured assignments.   
                --fmtNoRespace           Preserve whitespace in HDL expressions as is.  Do not 
                                           adjust whitespace to preserve alignment of elements 
                                           and comments of the expression.                     
                --fmtPack <Integer>      Generate HDL signals as packed to the given number of 
                                           levels of hierarchy.  (Overruled by --fmtPackAll.)  
                                           (default: 0)                                        
                --fmtPackAll             Generate HDL signals as packed at all levels of       
                                           hierarchy.  Also, forces behavior of --             
                                           fmtFlatSignals.                                     
                --fmtPackBooleans        Pack an additional level of hierarchy for boolean HDL 
                                           signals.                                            
                --fmtStripUniquifiers    Eliminate the use of uniquifiers in HDL names where   
                                           possible.                                           
                --fmtUseGenerate         Use the generate/endgenerate keywords that are        
                                           optional in SystemVerilog.                          
                -h, --help               Show help.                                            
                --hdl                    The extended and target hardware description          
                                           language.  One of: 'verilog', 'sv'.  This argument  
                                           is implicit if a project (--p) argument is given.

                --iArgs                  Process command-line arguments provided in the source 
                                           file.  This option is unsupported.                  
                --inlineGen              Produce the generated code in an inline code block    
                                           within the translated code, rather than in a        
                                           separate file.                                      
                --license                Can be used to downgrade the license permissions as

                --licenseFile            A file path to license key file against which to run, 
                                           specified relative to the distribution directory,   
                                           or as a full path.                                  
                --noDirectiveComments    For strict adherence to the Verilog specification, do 
                                           not output comments on `line and `include lines.    
                                           Most Verilog parsers are okay with comments, but    
                                           this is enabled automatically for --compiler        
                                           modelsim due to unpredictable parsing errors.       
                --noline                 Disable `line directive in SV output.

                                           directory.  This can be useful if consistent output 
                                           is required by different distributions.             
                -o                       Produce the given translated HDL file (where the HDL  
                                           language is determined from the project (-p) arg).

                                           given.  If a path ending in "/" or no/empty arg is  
                                           given, the file name is derived from --basename or -
                                           i.  A value of "STDOUT" may also be used.           
                --outdir                 A root directory for all produced files as a relative 
                                           or absolute path.

                --randomUnassigned       Provide random stimulus to unassigned signals (using  
                                           Verilog $random()).                                 
                --reset0                 Applies *reset signal to all flip-flops, resetting    
                                           them to zero values.  This applies only to projects 
                                           that leave the flop definition to SandPiper and for 
                                           flops that would not be otherwise reset.  Reset is  
                                           not applied to latches. This supports teams with    
                                           such a reset methodology, but is a bit counter to   
                                           TL-Verilog timing abstraction.  This flag has a     
                                           functional impact that may be incompatible with     
                                           library components.                                 
                --scrub                  Produce the given scrubbed TL-X file (specified as    
                                           with -o arg).  The scrubbed file is a canonical TL- 
                                           X representation of SandPiper's interpretation of   
                                           the model.  For a well-formetted, warning-free      
                                           source file, this file should be identical.         
                --time                   Report program runtime to STDOUT.  (Note, this makes  
                                           output unique w/ each run.)                         
                --verbose                Verbose output for debug.                             
                --xclk                   Enable X-injection on the clock when clock            
                                           gating/enabling logic is generated according to --  
                                           clk* parameters.  Specifically, drive X, rather     
                                           than zero, on the clock gate or clock enable signal 
                                           for deasserted 'when' conditions.                   
                --xinj                   Enable X-injection at pipesignal assignment           
                                           statements (those with deasserted 'when'            
                                           conditions).  Supported for SystemVerilog only.     

                Command-line formatting is flexible. For example, the following are equivalent:
                        java -jar /home/app/sandpiper/target/sandpiper.jar -i in/path/dut.tlv -o ../out/dut.sv --html ../out/dut.html
                        java -jar /home/app/sandpiper/target/sandpiper.jar -i=in/path/dut.tlv --outidr=../out -o -html
                (The latter, using "=", is preferred.)

                Exit status reflects the highest-severity error message.
                Details about status codes is available using "--help=errors".
Non-zero status indicates failure. Failures from SandPiper return that status. Other failures return status of greater than 100 (decimal).
